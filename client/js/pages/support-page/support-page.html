                <ul>
                    <li>Rater ID Number – Raters accounts must include a valid Rater ID number to perform HERS and ENERGY STAR ratings</li>
                    <li>V3 Eligible – Though all Raters may perform standalone HERS inspections, raters conducting ENERGY STAR ratings must have completed <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=bldrs_lenders_raters.nh_v3_training_req" target="_blank">ENERGY STAR Version 3 Training</a>.</li>
