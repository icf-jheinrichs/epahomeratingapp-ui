                <p>Any contact with a <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=mesa.showlogin" target="_blank">My ENERGY STAR Account (MESA)</a> can be added to an organization’s RaterPRO account. You can add additional contacts through MESA or by contacting <a href="mailto:energystarhomes@energystar.gov" target="_blank">energystarhomes@energystar.gov</a>.</p>

                <p>When an organization begins using RaterPRO, an account invitation e-mail will be sent to the primary contact. That primary RaterPRO user can then invite additional users on the ‘Users’ tab. </p>

                <p>The Users tab shows a list of eligible users, based on the organizations MESA account. Users with Rater, Rater Admin or Provider permissions checked already have accounts. To invite a new user, select one or more permissions check boxes (Rater, Rater Admin or Provider) for that user and click ‘Save’, which will trigger an automated invitation e-mail to the email address listed for that user.</p>

                <p>Note: e-mail addresses are based on contact’s My ENERGY STAR Account (MESA) and, if incorrect, should be updated through MESA. Updates will be reflected in RaterPRO within 24 hours.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Rating Type – Indicate if this is an ENERGY STAR rating, or a HERS-only rating</li>
